# 100 Days of Python

This is my journey through the **100 Days of Code** challenge.  
I’m learning Python step by step and building small projects every day.

## What’s here
- Daily folders with code and notes  
- Projects range from beginner exercises to useful apps  
- A record of my progress and consistency

## Why I’m doing this
To make Python my foundation language, improve my coding habits, and build a portfolio I can be proud of.

## Progress
- Day 1: Band Name Generator  
- Day 2: Tip Calculator  
- Day 3: Treasure Island Game  
- …and more to come

## Note
This repo is not about perfect code. It’s about learning, practicing, and getting better every day.
