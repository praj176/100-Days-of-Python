# Day 1 – Band Name Generator 🎸

This is my first project from the **100 Days of Python** challenge.  
The program asks the user for their city and pet’s name, then generates a fun band name by combining them.

## 📝 Concepts Learned
- **`print()` function** → Displaying output to the console.
- **Escape sequences** → Using `\n` for new lines.
- **String manipulation** → Concatenating strings with `+`.
- **`input()` function** → Taking user input (always as a string).
- **Variables** → Storing values in memory for reuse.
- **`len()` function** → Measuring string length.
- **Variable swapping** → Classic 3‑line swap and Python’s one‑liner.
- **Variable naming rules** → Readable, no spaces, one single unit (e.g., `user_name`).
