Day 1 – Band Name Generator 🎸

This is my first day from the 100 Days of Python challenge.  
The program asks the user for their city and pet’s name, then generates a fun band name by combining them.

Concepts Learned
- `print()` function → Displaying output to the console.
- Escape sequences → Using `\n` for new lines.
- String manipulation → Concatenating strings with `+`.
- 'input()` function → Taking user input (always as a string).
- Variables → Storing values in memory for reuse.
- `len()` function → Measuring string length.
- Variable swapping → Classic 3‑line swap and Python’s one‑liner.
- Variable naming rules → Readable, no spaces, one single unit (e.g., `user_name`).
